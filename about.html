    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Zane Hutchison and I'm an 18-year-old from Australia who is currently studying a Bachelor of
      Computer Science. I’ve been investing my own money since February 2019 and have been trying to compound my
      knowledge along with my money ever since then. Net net investing appeals to me due to its clear-cut criteria,
      wide margins of safety and fantastic returns.</p>

    <p>The first investing book I read was The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, which I gathered was the
      book to read on the topic as it was recommended in Alice Schroeder’s The Snowball. Warren Buffett’s
      recommendation proved useful in the sense that it pointed me in the right direction, but most of the contents
      of the book went straight over my head at the time. I’ve since reread it.</p>

    <p>However, the seed was planted, and I set off to buy my first company, Apple. My reasoning behind this at the
      time was something along the lines of “the bad press is only temporary, earnings keep going up, price has gone
      down and I have an iPhone”. Not long after this somewhat educated speculation Warren Buffett announced he had
      purchased a slightly larger position than my own in the company. Admittedly, I felt like a genius.</p>

    <p>Despite this classic example of beginner’s luck, I felt uneasy in the knowledge that it was simply that.
      Beginner’s luck. Hence, my journey to figure exactly what I was doing with my life savings began, and after
      roughly a year and a half I have found the what. I’m an addict.</p>

    <p>I love discussing anything investing so if you’d like to contact me about the website, your own stock picks
      or just to have a chat, click here.</p>
