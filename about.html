        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Zane Hutchison and I’m a Computer Science student at The University of the Sunshine Coast. I have
          always found creating things with a computer to be a fascinating prospect, and when I found coding it
          instantly clicked. Since that time I have worked on a slew of personal and paid projects which have been both
          a fun and educational experience. I especially enjoy anything that includes both a technical and a design
          aspect to it, as it lets me use my creative side.</p>

        <p>When I’m not coding I enjoy surfing, drawing and researching investments. Even though all of these interests
          are extremely differentiated I have found that coding can be applied to almost any area of life. For
          example, my endeavours into investing have been aided by my ability to code through the manipulation of
          financial data. So if you have a personal or business related project you’d like for me to work on, please
          feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me!</p>
