      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Zane Hutchison and I'm an 19-year-old who is currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at
        The
        University of the Sunshine Coast. I have always been interested in utilising computers to create things so
        Computer Science felt like a natural choice. My first venture into coding was in 2017 when I found Python
        tutorials on how to code and since then I haven't looked back.</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding I enjoy surfing, working out and researching investments. Interestingly enough, my
        endeavours into investing have been aided by my ability to code through compiling data for stock screens. This
        is another reason I love coding as it is a skill that can be applied to almost any topic.</p>
